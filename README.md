# OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling Project Overview
The main point of this project was to learn to access data and perform data cleaning with Python. This project was completed using data from openstreetmap.org and was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The final project can be viewed in the Jupiter notebook: [OSM_project_doc.ipynb](https://github.com/dustinkraft/udacity_openstreetmap/blob/main/OSM_project_doc.ipynb)https://github.com/dustinkraft/udacity_openstreetmap/blob/main/OSM_project_doc.ipynb
